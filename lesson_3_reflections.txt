When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- Useful for sharing code with others. E.g. others can collaboration on projects.
- Also useful when using multiple computers. E.g. I have several Raspberry Pis and old Linux machines. 
I will often code on multiple machines. Using a remote repository allows me to stay in sync.
