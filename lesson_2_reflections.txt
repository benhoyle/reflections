What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The Git configuration/system files are created and the folder begins to be 
treated as a new Git repository. No commits are present though. You
can run 'git status' to check the current status of the newly initialized
repository.

You need to do this so that Git can start tracking your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

It is an intermediate stage that is added to the repository as part of a 
 commit. You add files to the staging area using 'git add'. It is useful
 as it allows control over which files are commited. This may have security
 benefits and may be useful in logically separating changes.
